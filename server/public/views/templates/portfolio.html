        <p><a href="https://fussbudget.herokuapp.com/">Fussbudget</a> is my solo project from my time at Prime Digital Academy.
          It's a mobile-first scheduling and reminder webapp, designed to help caretakers of small children or others who
          need assistance keep on schedule with daily activities like diaper changes, feedings, naps, and the like.</p>
        <p>I'm particularly proud of the simple, light-touch Material Design interface. You don't have much time or attention
          to spare when you're caring for someone, and Fussbudget does everything it needs to with minimal user interaction
          and maximum clarity of pertinent information.</p>
        <p>Building the scheduling backend was a lot of fun. The 'edit wakeup' feature, which adjusts the entire schedule when
          a user tells the app that they woke up at a different time than usual, was a tricky bit of logic to code. Keeping
          everything on a 15-minute "tick" was a non-trivial piece of work, but it's a neat feature that I'm quite happy
          with.

          <p>My group project at Prime was for a Minneapolis nonprofit called Aeon. We built an iPad-first survey app, localized
            to four languages, which replaces a cumbersome paper process. </p>
          <p>The cool part, though, was the backend. The rest of the group handled most of the frontend work, but the backend
            was almost all my creation. Nobody seriously thought I was going to be able to implement charts and graphs in
            the reporting section in the tiny three-week timeframe we were working with, but implement them I did.</p>

          <p>And the import/export functionality for getting data in and out of the app, and most of the routes for the CRUD
            of the app itself. Not gonna lie, I am pretty proud of what I got done on this one.</p>

        <p>My pre-coding career had some decent highlights. I am so thankful to everyone who gave me the opportunities to walk
          the road that has led me here. Some of my favorite moments, immortalized online:</p>

        <p>This was fun. I got to present the game I was working on at the time - Ashes of the Singularity - to a live theater
          audience and of course a gajillion livestream viewers.</p>

        <p> I built the vast majority of the single-player content for Stardock's Ashes of the Singularity, a sci-fi real-time
          strategy game for Windows. Learning (and later extending the functionality of) the custom XML parser that the engine
          uses to create game scripts was a, well, a unique challenge. I'm extremely proud of what I was able to design and
          implement.
        </p>
        <p> Ashes was always intended to be a 'skirmish' game (where two or more evenly matched players battle across symmetrical
          maps), but I made some pretty darn cool asymmetric single-player scenarios nonetheless.</p>

        <br/> Also fun: Interviewing the team behind The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, recording videos, writing the Game Informer
        cover story, and producing and coordinating a month of digital content to go with it.
